Q1. Which of the following describes a valid test objective? 
A. Prove no unfixed defects exist. - ❌ Impossible — testing can only show presence of defects, never prove absence. 
B. Prove no failures will occur in production. ❌ Unrealistic — testing cannot guarantee future error-free operation. 
C. Reduce risk level of the test object and build confidence in quality. 
D. Verify there are no untested combinations of inputs. ❌ Coverage is important, but not a full test objective (too narrow). 
✅ Answer: C – Testing builds confidence and reduces risk; it cannot prove absence of defects or guarantee zero failures. 

 
 

Q2. Which activity contributes most to success in testing? 
A. Involving testers during SDLC activities to detect defects early. 
B. Testers avoiding interaction with developers. ❌ Wrong — collaboration is essential, isolation reduces quality. 
C. Testers collaborating with end users to improve defect reports. ❌ Helpful, but not as impactful as early lifecycle involvement. 
D. Certified testers always designing better test cases. ❌ Certification ≠ guaranteed better test design; experience matters more. 
✅ Answer: A – Early tester involvement = early defect detection (cheaper & faster). 

 
 

Q3. Which is not an example of shift-left? 
A. Reviewing requirements before stakeholder acceptance. ❌ Valid shift-left — early review of docs. 
B. Writing component tests before coding. ❌ Valid shift-left — testing earlier at unit/component level. 
C. Running performance efficiency tests during component testing. ❌ Still shift-left — testing quality attributes earlier. 
D. Writing a test script before configuration management is in place. 
✅ Answer: D – Shift-left = earlier testing. Writing test scripts without infrastructure is not aligned. 

 
 

Q4. Regression tests are unchanged across iterations and no defects found. Manager is happy, tester is not. Which principle applies? 
A. Tests wear out. 
B. Absence-of-errors fallacy. ❌ Means finding no defects ≠ product is useful. Not the scenario here. 
C. Defects cluster together. ❌ Principle about defects concentrating in a few modules, unrelated here. 
D. Exhaustive testing is impossible. ❌ True principle, but not related to regression tests losing effectiveness. 
✅ Answer: A – Tests become less effective over time (pesticide paradox). 

 
 

Q5. Team develops a food-ordering app with new payment feature. Which is part of test analysis? 
A. Estimating integration effort (8 days). ❌ Test estimation, not analysis. 
B. Deciding to test payment sharing between users. 
C. Using boundary value analysis for minimum payment amount. ❌ That’s test design, not analysis. 
D. Analyzing actual vs expected payment result after a test run. ❌ That’s test execution, not analysis. 
✅ Answer: B – Test analysis = deciding what to test (scenarios). 

 
 

Q6. Which statement about a test condition is most correct? 
A. An attribute of a component/system verifiable by one or more test cases. 
B. A collection of input values and expected results. ❌ That’s a test case, not a condition. 
C. A specific testable aspect verifiable by a single test case. ❌ Wrong — one condition can require multiple test cases. 
D. Any potential issue that could occur during operation. ❌ That’s a risk, not a test condition. 
✅ Answer: A – Test condition = attribute/aspect; can require multiple test cases. 

 
 

Tips for Exam Prep 

Always watch for keywords (“most correct,” “not an example”). 

Recall ISTQB glossary definitions (e.g., difference between test condition vs test case vs risk). 

Apply testing principles (e.g., “tests wear out,” “absence-of-errors fallacy”) to situational questions.
