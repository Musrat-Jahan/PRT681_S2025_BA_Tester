Introduction to Software Testing

-What is software testing?
-Why testing is important?
-Difference between Verification (Are we building it right?) and Validation (Are we building the right thing?).

Types of Testing

-Unit Testing – testing small pieces of code in isolation.
-Integration Testing – testing interactions between modules.
-System Testing – testing the complete application.
-Acceptance Testing – validating against business requirements.

Approach:
Functional Testing – checks features work as expected.
Non-functional Testing – checks performance, security, usability.

Testing Methods:
-Manual Testing – human executes test cases.
-Automation Testing – tools or scripts run tests automatically.
-Static Testing – reviews, inspections, code analysis.
-Dynamic Testing – running the code and checking outputs.

Testing :
-Unit Testing
-Integration Testing
-System Testing
-User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Test Design:
-Test Case – what to test and how to test.
-Test Data – input values for testing.
-Test Scenario – high-level description of what to test.
- Expected Result vs Actual Result.

Testing Techniques:
Black Box Testing – no knowledge of internal code, focus on inputs and outputs.
White Box Testing – testing with knowledge of code structure.
Grey Box Testing – mix of both.
Boundary Value Analysis and Equivalence Partitioning – common test data strategies.

Bug Lifecycle:
Bug discovery → Logging → Assignment → Fix → Retest → Closure.
Bug severity vs priority.
