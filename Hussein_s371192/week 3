i watched three courses in linkedin
1. Test Automation Foundations
The course teaches why automation matters—it saves time, helps catch bugs early, and supports continuous development.
It introduces the Agile Testing Quadrants, a way to organize testing:
Q1: Developer tests (unit/integration)
Q2: Feature/business tests
Q3: Manual/user testing
Q4: Performance/security checks
It also covers how to start automation with tools, plan tests, and keep your automation healthy over time.

2. Planning and Releasing Software with Jira
This video walkthrough shows how to use Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket together to handle the whole software release process.

You learn to write requirements in Confluence, link them to tasks in Jira, plan releases (versions), track progress, release code in Bitbucket, and then review the results back in Confluence.

3. Introducing Postman – Managing Header Presets
This video segment explains how to save groups of common headers (like API key or content type) as presets in Postman.

Once saved, you can apply these to any request with one click instead of typing them each time—making your API testing faster and easier.
