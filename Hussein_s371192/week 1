In Week 1, our class was introduced to the Software Engineering Practice unit. The lecturer explained how we will simulate a real-world software development team. Each student was assigned a specific role, and I was assigned the role of Tester. We also discussed how our team would work together using tools like GitHub for version control and online collaboration. Our responsibilities include weekly workshops, role research, and tool practice.

Research on Role: (Software Tester
A software tester plays a critical role in the development process by:
Ensuring the software behaves as expected.
Catching bugs early in the development cycle.
Writing and executing test cases.
Working closely with developers and analysts to improve the product.
Verifying both functionality and user experience.)
