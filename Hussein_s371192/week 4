This week I learned about APIs and automation in Postman from two videos:

1.Communicate on the Web using Services
-APIs let different software talk to each other.
-They send requests (like asking for data) and get responses (like answers from a server).
-Web services use APIs so apps can share data, for example: a weather app getting live weather info.
-APIs make software faster, reusable, and easier to connect.

2.Why Automate Your API Tests (Postman)
-Manual testing is slow and can miss mistakes.
-Automated tests in Postman are faster, always give the same result, and run many times.
-They help find bugs early and can run automatically in CI/CD pipelines when new code is added.
-This makes software more reliable and saves testers time.
