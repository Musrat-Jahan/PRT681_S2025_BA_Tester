In Week 2, I learned how to use Postman for simple API testing. 
I sent a GET request to a sample API link "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1". 
The server replied with some JSON data and showed a 200 OK status, which means the request worked successfully. 
I also wrote a small test in Postman to automatically check if the response status is 200. 
When I ran the request, the test passed and showed a green tick. 
This helped me understand that Postman can be used not only to send requests but also to check if the responses are correct.
